## What is this?

**100 Days Of Ruby** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative, where I learn something new about **Ruby** every day during 100 days.


## Usage

These examples were compiled with **Ruby 2.5.1**. It is recommended to install this exactly version for a correct running.
