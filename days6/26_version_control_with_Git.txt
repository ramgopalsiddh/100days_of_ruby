Upon download and installation in your local machine (AWS Cloud9 comes pre-installed with Git), first time setup steps are required (only one time) for your git installation (for all environments):

git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
replace "Your name" and youremail@example.com above with your actual name and email address which you want shown on your repos.

To display git config settings, use the following command:

git config --list

Some useful git commands:

Your rails application already comes initialized with a Git repository. But if you have to initialize a git repository for an application you are working on, you can use the following command (do this from within the application directory):

git init

Note: if using Rails 5 or above, your application will already come with a git repository initiated, if you initiate a new one, it'll simply do the same step again.

To add/track all files, use the following command:

git add -A

To commit changes/updates/additions to repository, use the following command:

git commit -m "A useful message to help remember details of commit"

To check current state of file updates with already tracked/committed code in repo, check git status with the following command:

git status

To reject latest changes, you can use the following command:

git checkout -f

Setup online code repo with Github - Text directions and references
You can sign-up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/

Once signed-up, you can follow the steps in the video to create a new repository for your application.

If you chose SSH as the option to push existing repo, you will need to set up an SSH key unless you already have one.

To display your public SSH key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you don't have an SSH public key or are not sure, checkout the instructions here: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

When creating a GitHub repo for your application, you can click on the SSH button, then push existing repo:

git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgithubaccountname/test-app-6.git

git push -u origin master # Remember you only need to use this command the first time

To view remotes setup in your environment (from your app directory):

git remote -v

For future pushes to repository:

git push origin master
