---------------------------------------------------------
1.Add About page :- 

        Add About page and homework assignment - Text reference and code
        To add an About page to the application, first add the following route to the config/routes.rb folder:

        get 'about', to: 'pages#about'

        You can then add the about action to the pages controller like below:

        def about
        end
        Now you will need a view template, so add an about.html.erb file under the app/views/pages folder and fill in some text to display within it:

        <h1>This is the About page</h1>

        Once you save the file, you'll be able to preview this page by appending /about to your homepage. In your local machine it would be localhost:3000/about

        Homework:

        1. Create an alpha-blog application.

        2. Setup tracking with Git and make a commit of your code with the message "Initial commit". Set up a GitHub repository for the app.

        3. Create a home page view (as the root route) and an about page like the test app.

        4. Make sure you are able to start the server and preview the application. Take snapshots of the two pages (home and about) and post them to the Q & A.

        5. Make a commit of your code and push to your GitHub repository for the application.
