Structure of a Rails application - Text references

You can find the details of the individual folders in a Rails application 
(when it's created) here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Scroll down to section 3.2, skip the part about creating the new application and
 then you will find a listing of all the folders and their purpose in-depth.
